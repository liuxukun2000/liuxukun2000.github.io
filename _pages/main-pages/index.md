        Hello! I'm <strong>Xukun Liu (刘旭坤)</strong>, a passionate computer scientist currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science at Northwestern University. My journey in computer science is driven by a deep passion for innovative solutions and the transformative power of technology. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am the co-founder and CTO of CourtAI, a venture aimed at democratizing legal advice with cutting-edge technology to provide high-quality, accessible, and affordable legal services. 

        My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages including Python, Rust, C++, and Java, which I leverage to build robust and scalable solutions. I am particularly proficient in Natural Language Processing and have worked extensively with Large Language Models to enhance their efficiency and application. 

        Beyond the screen, I find joy in exploring the great outdoors, where the complexity of nature often inspires my professional creativity and problem-solving approach.
