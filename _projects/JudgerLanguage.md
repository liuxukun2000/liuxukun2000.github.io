collection: projects
permalink: /projects/jcoderdsl
excerpt: 'The Domain Specific Language for Online Judger is a DSL implemented using macros in Rust. It allows users without any Rust or programming knowledge to define evaluation tasks using simple statements. This DSL supports a variety of functions, including defining file systems, setting up runtime environments (such as nsjail, Docker, VMs), and specifying tasks. The compiler translates this DSL into Rust code for execution, ensuring high operational efficiency.'
