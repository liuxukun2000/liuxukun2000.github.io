excerpt: "Magics.AI is an open-source platform specifically aimed at the academic community. It is a comprehensive platform for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning and inference, utilizing various acceleration techniques to significantly reduce inference costs and latency. Due to its distributed nature, Magics.AI can easily integrate computational resources within institutions and even across universities. The platform provides a complete Python SDK and a user-friendly front-end interface, making it accessible to both computer scientists and non-computer scholars. With simple command-line tools, users can easily fine-tune models, lowering the barrier to entry and enabling scholars from diverse disciplines to effectively utilize AI. "
